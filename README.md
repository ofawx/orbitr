# orbitr
## Open source space flight simulator in Unity C#

Orbitr is a space flight simulator inspired by Kerbal Space Program. The aim of this project is to be a very simple and easy way to learn basic orbital mechanics.

The rocket model features a single gimballing rocket motor, with enough thrust to takeoff from the very small planet.

The feature roadmap for orbitr may include some or all of the following in the future:
* For education:
  - Intuitive camera controls
  - Orbital path visualisation to easily demonstrate the effect of orbital maneouvres
* For fun:
  - Improved visual model and details
  - Challenges, eg precision landing/orbital matching
  - Fuel limitations

Pull requests always welcome.
